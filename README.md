## MQSim Workload Definition
You can define your preferred set of workloads in the XML format. If the specified workload definition file does not exist, MQSim will create a sample workload definition file in XML format for you (i.e., workload.xml). Here is the explanation of the XML attributes and tags for the workload definition file:

1. The entire workload definitions should be embedded within <MQSim_IO_Scenarios></MQSim_IO_Scenarios> tags. You can define different sets of *I/O scenarios* within these tags. MQSim simulates each I/O scenario separately.

2. We call a set of workloads that should be executed together, an *I/O scenario*. An I/O scenario is defined within the <IO_Scenario></IO_Scenario> tags. For example, two different I/O scenarios are defined in the workload definition file in the following way:
```
<MQSim_IO_Scenarios>
	<IO_Scenario>
	.............
	</IO_Scenario>
	<IO_Scenario>
	.............
	</IO_Scenario>
</MQSim_IO_Scenarios>
```

For each I/O scenario, MQSim 1) rebuilds the Host and SSD Drive model and executes the scenario to completion, and 2) creates an output file and writes the simulation results to it. For the example mentioned above, MQSim builds the Host and SSD Drive models twice, executes the first and second I/O scenarios, and finally writes the execution results into the workload_scenario_1.xml and workload_scenario_2.xml files, respectively.

You can define up to 8 different workloads within each IO_Scenario tag. Each workload could either be a disk trace file that has already been collected on a real system or a synthetic stream of I/O requests that are generated by MQSim's request generator.

### Defining a Trace-based Workload
You can define a trace-based workload for MQSim, using the <IO_Flow_Parameter_Set_Trace_Based> XML tag. Currently, MQSim can execute ASCII disk traces define in [8] in which each line of the trace file has the following format:
1.Request_Arrival_Time 2.Device_Number 3.Starting_Logical_Sector_Address 4.Request_Size_In_Sectors 5.Type_of_Requests[0 for write, 1 for read]

The following parameters are used to define a trace-based workload:
1. **Priority_Class:** the priority class of the I/O queue associated with this I/O request. Range = {URGENT, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW}.
2. **Device_Level_Data_Caching_Mode:** the type of on-device data caching for this flow. Range={WRITE_CACHE, READ_CACHE, WRITE_READ_CACHE, TURNED_OFF}. If the caching mechanism mentioned above is set to SIMPLE, then only WRITE_CACHE and TURNED_OFF modes could be used.
3. **Channel_IDs:** a comma-separated list of channel IDs that are allocated to this workload. This list is used for resource partitioning. If there are C channels in the SSD (defined in the SSD configuration file), then the channel ID list should include values in the range 0 to C-1. If no resource partitioning is required, then all workloads should have channel IDs 0 to C-1.
4. **Chip_IDs:** a comma-separated list of chip IDs that are allocated to this workload. This list is used for resource partitioning. If there are W chips in each channel (defined in the SSD configuration file), then the chip ID list should include values in the range 0 to W-1. If no resource partitioning is required, then all workloads should have chip IDs 0 to W-1.
5. **Die_IDs:** a comma-separated list of chip IDs that are allocated to this workload. This list is used for resource partitioning. If there are D dies in each flash chip (defined in the SSD configuration file), then the die ID list should include values in the range 0 to D-1. If no resource partitioning is required, then all workloads should have die IDs 0 to D-1.
6. **Plane_IDs:** a comma-separated list of plane IDs that are allocated to this workload. This list is used for resource partitioning. If there are P planes in each die (defined in the SSD configuration file), then the plane ID list should include values in the range 0 to P-1. If no resource partitioning is required, then all workloads should have plane IDs 0 to P-1.
7. **Initial_Occupancy_Percentage:** the percentage of the storage space (i.e., logical pages) that is filled during preconditioning. Range = {all integer values in the range 1 to 100}.
8. **File_Path:** the relative/absolute path to the input trace file.
9. **Percentage_To_Be_Executed:** the percentage of requests in the input trace file that should be executed. Range = {all integer values in the range 1 to 100}.
10. **Relay_Count:** the number of times that the trace execution should be repeated. Range = {all positive integer values}.
11. **Time_Unit:** the unit of arrival times in the input trace file. Range = {PICOSECOND, NANOSECOND, MICROSECOND}

### Defining a Synthetic Workload
You can define a synthetic workload for MQSim, using the <IO_Flow_Parameter_Set_Synthetic> XML tag. 

The following parameters are used to define a trace-based workload:
1. **Priority_Class:** same as trace-based parameters mentioned above.
2. **Device_Level_Data_Caching_Mode:** same as trace-based parameters mentioned above.
3. **Channel_IDs:** same as trace-based parameters mentioned above.
4. **Chip_IDs:** same as trace-based parameters mentioned above.
5. **Die_IDs:** same as trace-based parameters mentioned above.
6. **Plane_IDs:** same as trace-based parameters mentioned above.
7. **Initial_Occupancy_Percentage:** same as trace-based parameters mentioned above.
8. **Working_Set_Percentage:** the percentage of available logical storage space that is accessed by generated requests. Range = {all integer values in the range 1 to 100}.
9. **Synthetic_Generator_Type:** determines the way that the stream of requests is generated. Currently, there are two modes for generating consecutive requests, 1) based on the average bandwidth of I/O requests, or 2) based on the average depth of the I/O queue. Range = {BANDWIDTH, QUEUE_DEPTH}.
10. **Read_Percentage:** the ratio of read requests in the generated flow of I/O requests. Range = {all integer values in the range 1 to 100}.
11. **Address_Distribution:** the distribution pattern of addresses in the generated flow of I/O requests. Range = {STREAMING, RANDOM_UNIFORM, RANDOM_HOTCOLD, MIXED_STREAMING_RANDOM}.
12. **Percentage_of_Hot_Region:** if RANDOM_HOTCOLD is set for address distribution, then this parameter determines the ratio of the hot region with respect to the entire logical address space. Range = {all integer values in the range 1 to 100}.
13. **Generated_Aligned_Addresses:** the toggle to enable aligned address generation. Range = {true, false}.
14. **Address_Alignment_Unit:** the unit that all generated addresses must be aligned to in sectors (i.e. 512 bytes). Range = {all positive integer values}.
15. **Request_Size_Distribution:** the distribution pattern of request sizes in the generated flow of I/O requests. Range = {FIXED, NORMAL}.
16. **Average_Request_Size:** average size of generated I/O requests in sectors (i.e. 512 bytes). Range = {all positive integer values}.
17. **Variance_Request_Size:** if the request size distribution is set to NORMAL, then this parameter determines the variance of I/O request sizes in sectors. Range = {all non-negative integer values}.
18. **Seed:** the seed value that is used for random number generation. Range = {all positive integer values}.
19. **Average_No_of_Reqs_in_Queue:** average number of I/O requests enqueued in the host-side I/O queue (i.e., the intensity of the generated flow). This parameter is used in QUEUE_DEPTH mode of request generation. Range = {all positive integer values}.
20. **Bandwidth:** the average bandwidth of I/O requests (i.e., the intensity of the generated flow) in bytes per seconds. MQSim uses this parameter in BANDWIDTH mode of request generation.
21. **Stop_Time:** defines when to stop generating I/O requests in nanoseconds.
22. **Total_Requests_To_Generate:** if Stop_Time is set to zero, then MQSim's request generator considers Total_Requests_To_Generate to decide when to stop generating I/O requests.


## Analyze MQSim's XML Output
You can use an XML processor to easily read and analyze an MQSim output file. For example, you can open an MQSim output file in MS Excel. Then, MS Excel shows a set of options and you should choose "Use the XML Source task pane". The XML file is processed in MS Excel and a task pane is shown with all output parameters listed in it. In the task pane on the right, you see different types of statistics available in the MQSim's output file. To read the value of a parameter, you should:<br />
1. Drag and drop that parameter from the task source pane to the Excel sheet.,<br />
2. Right click on the cell that you have dropped the parameter and select *XML* > *Refresh XML Data* from the drop-down menue.
